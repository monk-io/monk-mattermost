# Mattermost-enterprise  & Monk

This repository contains Monk.io template to deploy Mattermost-enterpise system either locally or on cloud of your choice (AWS, GCP, Azure, Digital Ocean).

This template includes Nginx as a reverse proxy and PostgreSQL to work with  Mattermost-enterprise out of box.

## Start

Set up Monk - https://docs.monk.io/docs/monk-in-10/

Start `monkd` and login.

```bash
monk login --email=<email> --password=<password>
```

## Clone Monk Mattermost-enterprise repository

In order to load templates and change configuration simply use below commands: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/monk-io/monk-mattermost.git

# and change directory to the mattermost-enterprise template folder
cd mattermost-enterprise
```


## Configuration

You can add/remove configuration of the template.

The current variables can be found in `mattermost-enterprise/stack/variables` section

```yaml
  variables:
    defines: variables
    database-user:
      type: string

## Local Deployment

First clone the repository and change the current directory to the /mattermost-enterprise folder and simply run below command after launching `monkd`:
:

```bash
➜  monk load MANIFEST

✨ Loaded:
 ├─🔩 Runnables:
 │  ├─🧩 mattermost-enterprise/nginx
 │  ├─🧩 mattermost-enterprise/mattermost
 │  └─🧩 mattermost-enterprise/database
 ├─🔗 Process groups:
 │  └─🧩 mattermost-enterprise/stack
 └─⚙️ Entity instances:
    └─🧩 mattermost-enterprise/mattermost/metadata
✔ All templates loaded successfully

➜  monk list mattermost-enterprise

✔ Got the list
Type      Template                          Repository             Version      Tags
runnable  mattermost-enterprise/database    local                  12           dataops, database

group     mattermost-enterprise/stack       local                  -            -
runnable  nginx/latest                      mattermost-enterprise  -            -
runnable  nginx/reverse-proxy               mattermost-enterprise  -            -
runnable  nginx/reverse-proxy-ssl-certbot   mattermost-enterprise  1.15-alpine  nginx, reverse proxy, ssl, certbot
➜  monk run mattermost-enterprise/stack

✔ Started mattermost-enterprise/stack
```

This will start the entire mattermost-enterprise/stack  with a Nginx reverse proxy and Postgresql. 

To access mattermost-enterprise from local system, required  dns entry needs to be added in local host file as following format: 

```
 127.0.0.1 <mattermost-server-name>
```

## Cloud Deployment

To deploy the above system to your cloud provider, create a new Monk cluster and provision your instances.

```bash
➜  monk cluster new
? New cluster name mattermost-preview
✔ Cluster created
Your cluster has been created successfully.

➜  monk cluster provider add -p gcp -f <path/to/your-key.json>
✔ Provider added successfully

➜  monk cluster grow -p gcp
? Cloud provider gcp
? Name of the new instance my-instance
? Tags (split by whitespace) mattermost
? Region europe-central2
? Zone europe-central2-a
? Instance type e2-medium
? Number of instances (or press ENTER to use default = 1) 3
? Default disk type for gcp is HDD (pd-standard). Would you like to change it? No
? Disk size (or press ENTER to use default = 250 GBs) 50
✔ Start creation of new instance(s) on gcp... DONE
✔ Creating node: my-instance-1 DONE
✔ Initializing node: my-instance-1 DONE
✔ Creating node: my-instance-2 DONE
✔ Initializing node: my-instance-2 DONE
✔ Creating node: my-instance-3 DONE
✔ Initializing node: my-instance-3 DONE
✔ Connecting: my-instance-1 DONE
✔ Syncing peer: my-instance-1 DONE
✔ Connecting: my-instance-2 DONE
✔ Connecting: my-instance-3 DONE
✔ Syncing peer: my-instance-2 DONE
✔ Syncing peer: my-instance-3 DONE
✔ Syncing nodes DONE
✔ Cluster grown successfully
```

Once cluster is ready execute the same command as for local and select your cluster (the option will appear automatically).

➜  monk load MANIFEST
